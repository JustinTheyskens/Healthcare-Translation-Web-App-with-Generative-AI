# Healthcare-Translation-Web-App-with-Generative-AI
A web-based prototype that enables real-time, multilingual translation between patients and healthcare providers. This application should convert spoken input into text, provide a live transcript, and offer a translated version with audio playback.

## Core Functionalities:

- Voice-to-Text with Generative AI: Convert spoken input into a text transcript, using AI to enhance transcription accuracy, especially for medical terms.
- Real-Time Translation and Audio Playback: Provide real-time translation of the transcript with a "Speak" button for audio playback.
- Mobile-First Design: Ensure the app is responsive and optimized for mobile and desktop use.

## Technical Requirements:

- Generative AI Tools: Use generative AI (OpenAI) for both translation and coding assistance.
- Speech Recognition API: Integrate a speech recognition API (Google Speech-to-Text).
- Deployment Platform: Deploy on a platform like Vercel, V0, or Cursor. Provide a live link.
- Data Privacy and Security: Ensure patient confidentiality with basic security measures.

## Deliverables:
- Prototype Link: Submit a live, accessible link to the deployed web app.
- Code Documentation: Outline the code structure, AI tools, and security considerations.
- User Guide: A brief guide to using the appâ€™s features.
- Presentation: An explanation of your approach and how generative AI was used.
